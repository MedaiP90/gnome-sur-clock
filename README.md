# Gnome Sur Clock

**WARNING: this project isn't under active development any more. If some good samaritan would test the extension on new releases of GNOME and update the file `metadata.json`, I'll manage future pull requests (if any).**

Move the clock to the left or the right of the system indicators like in MacOs.
